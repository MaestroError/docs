{/* TODO: Document custom storage creation */}

This page is under construction. Check back soon for detailed documentation on creating custom storages.

## Overview

Custom storages allow you to persist any structured data within your agent's context — customer notes, conversation tags, session metadata, and more.

## Key Concepts

- **DataModel** — Typed data classes that define your storage items
- **DataModelArray** — Collections of DataModels with filtering and transformation methods
- **Storage** — Abstract base class handling persistence, lazy loading, and dirty tracking

## Coming Soon

- Creating a DataModel for your storage items
- Extending the Storage abstract class
- Registering custom storages with the Context
- Querying and filtering stored data
