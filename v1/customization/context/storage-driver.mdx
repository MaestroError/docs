{/* TODO: Document custom storage driver creation */}

This page is under construction. Check back soon for detailed documentation on creating custom storage drivers.

## Overview

Storage drivers handle the actual persistence of data to various backends. You can create custom drivers for specialized storage needs — custom databases, external APIs, cloud services, and more.

## Key Concepts

- **StorageDriver** — Interface for persistence backends
- **readFromMemory()** — Load data from the storage backend
- **writeToMemory()** — Save data to the storage backend
- **removeFromMemory()** — Delete data from the storage backend

## Coming Soon

- Implementing the StorageDriver interface
- Integrating with external services
- Handling serialization and deserialization
- Error handling and fallback strategies
