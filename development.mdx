   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/LarAgent.git
   cd LarAgent
   ```

## Coding Guidelines

When contributing to LarAgent, please follow these guidelines to ensure your code meets our standards:

### Code Style

- Use type hints and return types where possible

- Keep methods focused and concise
- Follow PSR-12 coding standards

LarAgent uses PHP CS Fixer to maintain code style. You can run it with:

### Testing

All new features and bug fixes should include tests. LarAgent uses [PEST](https://pestphp.com/) for testing.

- Add tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting:
  ```bash
  composer test
  ```
- Maintain or improve code coverage

### Documentation

Good documentation is crucial for any project:

- Add PHPDoc blocks for new classes and methods
- Include examples for new features
- Consider updating the [official documentation](https://github.com/MaestroError/docs) for major changes

### Commit Guidelines

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Reference issues and pull requests in your commits
- Keep commits focused and atomic

## Pull Request Process

Follow these steps to submit your contributions:

1. **Update your fork** with the latest changes from main:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/MaestroError/LarAgent.git
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Push your changes** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Create a Pull Request** with:
   - Clear title and description
   - List of changes and impact
   - Any breaking changes highlighted
   - Screenshots/examples if relevant

The maintainers aim to review all pull requests within 2 weeks.
